Born for war
Shaped by violence
Bathed in blood
A sentient who began life in the midst of a fight.
He was playing with his blocks in his room, oblivious of the storm brewing in the other room.
He heard the high pitched screaming of his mother, then the crash for flesh hitting flesh, followed by his mother bursting into his room.
She scooped him up and ran out the door with him. 
This is the scene this soul began his memory, and would shape it as it first formed.
His mother did what she could to support, she did what she knew. Her body became a bartering tool, and her time unavailable to him.
He began to learn to raise himself in her absence, he supplemented her income with dealings on the street.
He had learned to gamble at a very early age, along with this he learned to cheat.
This caused trouble more than once, but usually he found a way out of it. The day he didn't get away, changed his life forever.
He was working his stand when a small gang of boys walked towards his stand, he reconized one of them from a heist the day before.
He knew this was not going to go well, but by the time he was about to head out, they had surrounded him.
What elapsed next became a blur to him. All he remembered was that the boys started to push him around in a circle and then he snapped.
When he came to from blacking out, the boys were on the ground with various injures. He looked down to find the leader's head, crushed under his foot.
He didn't know what to do, he was covered in blood, not exactly concious of what actually happened. He ran home as fast as he could.
When he got home he disposed of he blood-matted clothes and got in the shower. He watched as the water turned red, mixing with caked blood on his skin.
He looked at his hands. The water stung as it washed over the cuts and scraps on his body. He kept staring at the hands that now had commited murder.
